# Sietsma site todo

- need to plan the future! At the moment just quickly moving stuff to github pages

---- below this is old stuff ---

Plan:
- maybe some background colour?  Sidebar for wide screens? past-edge frills?
-- avoid sharp black and white? Steal from wedding invite colours? :)
- think about pretty things from bourbon bitters or refill
- finish removing kraken - anything left to steal?
- check if we are using Optimus for links, images
- make it possible for themes to take any frontmatter?
- fix favico

Content:
- maps and directions
- page / info for evening guests
- aus wedding details
- aus wedding banner?  NYE shots?

- aus mardos location
- map links


Done:
- responsive for james
- smaller, retina friendly banner image
- switched to neat bourbon and bitters
- a markdown file should become a page in a default layout
- markdowns take frontmatter to define a hiccup theme
- a hiccup file should actually be a map of :title :body-class :page and maybe others?
