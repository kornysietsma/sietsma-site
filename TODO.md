# Sietsma site todo

need to plan the future! At the moment just quickly moving stuff to github pages and off clojure

* make it prettier - can we steal a Jekyll theme?
* make it simpler - can we ditch all the frameworks?  Modern CSS does a lot for us.
* add Dr Sietsma pages - including Arie's translation of the book
* fix favicon
