Welcome to the Sietsma Family Web Page!  This site is for the use of members of the extended Sietsma family in Australia, the UK and worldwide.  If you have any queries, please contact Korny Sietsma via email : korny (at) this domain.

## Pages

### Korny home page

I have a basic [home page here](/korny/) - though mostly it's a pointer to my korny.info pages.

### Dr K Sietsma pages

I have added some pages about [my Grandfather, Dr Kornelis Sietsma](/dr_k_sietsma/) - a great man, sadly killed by the Nazis for preaching against the abuses of power.  A translation of his biography, and other related pages, are linked from the above page.

## Site history

This site has been around a long time, but doesn't have much content at the moment. The first site dates back to around 2000, then it was rebuilt in 2009, then again in 2015 I rebuilt it slowly from scratch - mainly as the css here was embarrassing, and I wanted to put up pages for my upcoming wedding!

And now it's 2024, the wedding was marvellous, but the pages were pretty out of date!  I have yet again reworked it - using Jekyll as I want something simple to maintain for my once-every-5-years effort.

## If you want something here

If you are a Sietsma, and you want a link or some simple (markdown and images) content here, e-mail me and I'd be happy to help set it up.

 If you are technical - the site is all in Markdown rendered with Jekyll, the source code is at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/sietsma-site> - and I'm happy to accept simple [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
