# Sietsma family

Welcome to the Sietsma Family Web Page!  This site is for the use of members of the extended Sietsma family in Australia, the UK and worldwide.  If you have any queries, please contact Korny Sietsma via email : korny (at) this domain.

This page is in flux - it was updated in 2000, then 2009, then in 2015 I rebuilt it slowly from scratch - mainly as the css here was embarrassing, and I wanted to put up pages for my upcoming wedding!

And now it's 2024, the wedding was marvellous, and I want to add more content. I reworked the basic publishing to use Jekyll, now I might revisit other bits.  Slowly as usual.

## Local Home Pages

There is only one home page on this site at the moment - [mine!](korny/)

If you are a Sietsma, and you want a link to your home page or other content here, e-mail me and I'd be happy to help set it up. If you are technical - the site is all in Markdown rendered with Jekyll, the source code is at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/sietsma-site> - and I'm happy to accept simple [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
