_this page is a work in progress_

C. J. Sikkel wrote a short book about Dr Sietsma in 1946.

Dr Sietsma's son Arie Sietsma wrote an English translation around 1996. His grandson Kornelis (Korny) - author of this page - is working on a new cleaned-up translation based on Arie's work, plus using modern tools to translate the original Dutch (and possibly the help of some Dutch-speaking friends)

At the moment I have:

- A scanned copy of the original book (to be uploaded)
- [My OCR of the scanned book](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/ocr_book) (this may have mistakes - OCR isn't perfect, and I haven't always been able to catch the errors)
- [Arie's Translation](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/arie_translation) - I only had an old Word document so it may have a few glitches
- [An automated translation using a LLM translator](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/llm_translation_1)
