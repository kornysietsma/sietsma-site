_this page is a work in progress_ - I have almost finished my translation but it needs review.

C. J. Sikkel wrote a short book about Dr Sietsma in 1946.

Dr Sietsma's son Arie Sietsma wrote an English translation around 1996. His grandson Kornelis (Korny) - author of this page - is working on a new cleaned-up translation based on Arie's work, plus using large language model tools to review it and modernise the language (with some checks from Dutch speaking friends)

[This is my current draft translation](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/2024_translation)

My sources are:

- I scanned the original book myself - images are too big for this site but contact me if you want a copy
- The [Dutch text of the scanned book](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/ocr_book) (this may have mistakes - OCR isn't perfect, and I haven't always been able to catch the errors)
- [My uncle Arie's 1996 Translation](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/arie_translation) - I only had an old Word document so it may have a few glitches
