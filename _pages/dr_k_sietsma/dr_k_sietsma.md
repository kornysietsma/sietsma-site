Dr Kornelis Sietsma was my ([Korny's](/korny)) grandfather.

He was a theologian and a Dutch Reformed Church minister in Amsterdam during World War 2. He preached in ways which angered the Nazi occupiers, they sent him to Dachau concentration camp where he died not long after.

I am building some pages about his life - there are various resources around the internet, but they are a bit scattered and many are not in English - I want something to share with my English-speaking family.

## Een Waarlijk Vrije

C. J. Sikkel wrote a brief biography of Dr Sietsma in 1946 - I'm working on translations of this, see [Een Waarlijk Vrie](/dr_k_sietsma/een_waarlijk_vrie/) for the progress here.

## Existing resources

- There is a [Dutch Wikipedia page about him](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornelis_Sietsma) which is an excellent overview
