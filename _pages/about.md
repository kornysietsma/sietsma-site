I (Korny) grabbed the domain `sietsma.com` ages ago, when domains were new, as I thought it'd be nice to have my own email address and maybe website.

I made an early sietsma.com site not long after that, but it has been ancient and crufty for a very long time.

A while later I grabbed [korny.info](https://korny.info) as well, as I thought I'd like a more casual, less global domain for my personal pages and blog and the rest.

This site has been pretty stagnant since, apart from occasional tech updates (and simplifications, as my life is busier and I no longer have time to tweak CSS)
