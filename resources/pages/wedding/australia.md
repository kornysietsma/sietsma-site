You can get there by car - there should be parking in the streets nearby - or by Tram, the 109 route stops 127 is quite close by.

## Outline of the evening

We will have a short ceremony upstairs at 6pm, to re-state our commitment, this time including all of our lovely Australian friends and family.

Then there will be dinner and merriment into the evening, in the restaurant downstairs.

## Dress

We'd like people to be themselves and enjoy themselves!  Dress up or dress down as you like.  If you want to dress extravagantly, feel free; if you feel most comfortable in a black t-shirt and jeans, that's fine too!
