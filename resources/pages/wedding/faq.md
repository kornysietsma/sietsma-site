They are questions, and they aren't all that frequent, but just in case...

## What is the dress code?

We've said "Dress up or dress down" - but some folks would like something a bit more explicit!

Becky and Korny will be dressing up - it's our wedding, we want to be pretty!  And so will much of the bridal party.

However, we have a wonderful diverse range of friends and family, and we want people to enjoy themselves and be comfortable.
So if you feel happier in all purple, that's fine.  If you want to wear all black t-shirt and jeans, that's fine as well.  If you want
to wear a top hat and tails, go for it!

I hope that makes sense.

## What's the hashtag?

Oh dear.  You know, in 10 years time hash tags will be horribly dated and embarassing, and only something old people even talk about.

But for now, if you want to tag something on TwitMyFace or wherever, **#BeckyAndKorny** will help our robot overlords categorise your
contributions for posterity.
