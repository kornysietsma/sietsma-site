## Accommodation 
Please be aware that it's the Moto Grand Prix at Silverstone (10 miles west) on the same weekend. 

Hotels and B&Bs in and around Milton Keynes are already booking up and many have hiked up their prices.

If you are having trouble finding accommodation, please call or email Becky as we have a couple of options.

If you're feeling like this wedding is all about life on the farm, there is always.... camping ....

## Camping at Furtho
We are very pleased to be able to offer free camping on site in a large field at the farm.
You're welcome to camp Friday and Saturday nights. Or you could set up your tent (or give us your tent to set up) on Friday and just stay Saturday.
There's toilets for campers in a brick building just outside the field but no showers. There's a tap for drinking water.

### Campers breakfast
Becky's sisters, Cathy and Liz, are organising 'campers breakfast' for Sunday morning.

It'll be set up, probably in the barn where we will have had the party, and will be a 'help yourself' affair.
With hot and cold breakfast options as well as tea and coffee. 

Please use the RSVP within the invite to let us know approximate numbers of people for breakfast, or email Cathy if you haven't let us know yet.

Any questions about camping please email Cathy on cath.williams5@gmail.com

## Gifts
Please see the [[registry]] page

## Dress

We'd like people to be themselves and enjoy themselves!  Dress up or dress down as you like.  If you want to dress extravagantly, feel free; if you feel most comfortable in a black t-shirt and jeans, that's fine too!

## Helpers
As you can probably tell, this wedding is very 'bespoke'. We're having lots of fun planning and putting it together. We really appreciate all offers of help and are coming up with things we need help with. If you're camping or staying near by we would really appreciate help with set up on Friday or packing up on the Sunday. Thank youuuuuu :)

## Outline of the day
The Ceremony will be at 12:30, hopefully outside though possibly in the barn.

After the ceremony there will be canapes and drinks, while various photographs are taken.

The reception will follow in the barn, and there will be food, drink and merriment.  And the bride needs to demonstrate her cricket skills!

Dancing and more food will continue into the evening.

### Wet weather plan
If it's raining, the ceremony will be in the barn - there's plenty of room, but it's nicer outside!

Regardless, you might want to think about shoes for dancing - and shoes for playing cricket on the grass.

Parking is in a field, 300 yards from the barn - so be prepared!

### Evening guests
We have invited a few guests just for the evening - there will be dancing and food until late.  More details here once we have the day schedule finalised.

## Directions
Becky drew these awesome maps for the invitations - they're too good not to reuse.
