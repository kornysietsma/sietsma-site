We love photos!  We'll be having someone taking some "proper" photos, but if you take any you want to share, we'd love to know.  There are three main options:
 
### WedPics

WedPics is a free site where you can upload photos.  We've registered the Wedding ID **BeckyAndKorny** - you can view or upload photos
in one of the following ways:

1. Go to the website - https://www.wedpics.com - you need to register with a FaceBook account or an email address.  Then enter the Wedding ID  and you can view and upload photos

2. On an Android, install [the Android wedpics app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dejami.WedPics&hl=en_GB) and enter the wedding ID, then you can upload photos directly from your phone (if you have data coverage at the venue!)

3. On an IPhone, install [the IPhone wedpics app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wedpics-wedding-photo-app/id549402355?mt=8) and enter the wedding ID, then you can upload photos directly from your phone (if you have data coverage at the venue!)

### HashTags

If you don't want to register with WedPics, you could put the photos on Instagram or Flickr or similar, and us a hashtag **#BeckyAndKorny** to tag them for us.  Please tell us via email if you do this, so we know where to search!

### Just send them to us

You can always email photos to us - or put them on DropBox or similar and send us a link!  BeckyAndKorny@sietsma.com
