There is no requirement to buy us presents - we'd love to see people at our wedding for themselves, not with any
sense of obligation!

If you'd _like_ to buy us something to celebrate our wedding, we've set up a page that has several options - you can give to
 a charity in our names, you can help fund our honeymoon, or you can give presents both traditional ("a coffee maker") and
 different ("icecreams at the beach")!
 
Simply go to http://www.sokindregistry.org/beckyandkorny and enter the word "wolverton" to get in.
