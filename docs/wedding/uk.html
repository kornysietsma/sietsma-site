<hr/><p><em>Detailed directions to Furtho are at the bottom of this page</em></p><h2>Accommodation</h2><p>Please be aware that it&rsquo;s the Moto Grand Prix at Silverstone (10 miles west) on the same weekend. </p><p>Hotels and B&amp;Bs in and around Milton Keynes are already booking up and many have hiked up their prices.</p><p>If you are having trouble finding accommodation, please call or email Becky as we have a couple of options.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re feeling like this wedding is all about life on the farm, there is always&hellip;. camping &hellip;.</p><h2>Camping at Furtho</h2><p>We are very pleased to be able to offer free camping on site in a large field at the farm. You&rsquo;re welcome to camp Friday and Saturday nights. Or you could set up your tent (or give us your tent to set up) on Friday and just stay Saturday. There&rsquo;s toilets for campers in a brick building just outside the field but no showers. There&rsquo;s a tap for drinking water.</p><h3>Campers breakfast</h3><p>Becky&rsquo;s sisters, Cathy and Liz, are organising &lsquo;campers breakfast&rsquo; for Sunday morning.</p><p>It&rsquo;ll be set up, probably in the barn where we will have had the party, and will be a &lsquo;help yourself&rsquo; affair. With hot and cold breakfast options as well as tea and coffee. </p><p>Please use the RSVP within the invite to let us know approximate numbers of people for breakfast, or email Cathy if you haven&rsquo;t let us know yet.</p><p>Any questions about camping please email Cathy on <a href="mailto:&#99;&#97;&#116;&#x68;&#46;&#119;&#x69;&#108;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6d;&#115;&#x35;&#64;&#103;m&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;.&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#99;&#97;&#116;&#x68;&#46;&#119;&#x69;&#108;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6d;&#115;&#x35;&#64;&#103;m&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;.&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a></p><h2>Gifts</h2><p>Please see the <a href="./registry.html">registry</a> page</p><h2>Dress</h2><p>We&rsquo;d like people to be themselves and enjoy themselves! Dress up or dress down as you like. If you want to dress extravagantly, feel free; if you feel most comfortable in a black t-shirt and jeans, that&rsquo;s fine too!</p><h2>Helpers</h2><p>As you can probably tell, this wedding is very &lsquo;bespoke&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re having lots of fun planning and putting it together. We really appreciate all offers of help and are coming up with things we need help with. If you&rsquo;re camping or staying near by we would really appreciate help with set up on Friday or packing up on the Sunday. Thank youuuuuu :)</p><h2>Outline of the day</h2><p>The Ceremony will be at 12:30, hopefully outside though possibly in the barn.</p><p>After the ceremony there will be canapes and drinks, while various photographs are taken.</p><p>The reception will follow in the barn, and there will be food, drink and merriment. And the bride needs to demonstrate her cricket skills!</p><p>Dancing and more food will continue into the evening.</p><h3>Wet weather plan</h3><p>If it&rsquo;s raining, the ceremony will be in the barn - there&rsquo;s plenty of room, but it&rsquo;s nicer outside!</p><p>Regardless, you might want to think about shoes for dancing - and shoes for playing cricket on the grass.</p><p>Parking is in a field, 300 yards from the barn - so be prepared!</p><h3>Evening guests</h3><p>We have invited a few guests just for the evening - there will be dancing and food until late. More details here once we have the day schedule finalised.</p><h2>Directions</h2><p>Becky drew these awesome maps for the invitations - they&rsquo;re too good not to reuse.</p><p><img src="/images/map_mk.png" alt="map of Milton Keynes area" title="Getting to Furtho""/></p><p><img src="/images/map_farm.png" alt="map of Furtho Manor Farm" title="Furtho Manor Farm""/></p><p>Or you can see it on Google:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d3932.945204761047!2d-0.8740650216632494!3d52.08021126161257!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1437076227602" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></section></body></html>
